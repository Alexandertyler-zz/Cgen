Fuck this project.

For this project we needed to extend our implementation in the previous project to
include code generation. Like before, we began by making a ClassTable that would 
both initialize our program and include starting code generation. It initialized
and set up the base classes of int io bool object and string. We noticed that in order
to make the proper inits in CgenTable we would need to store a bunch of information 
about each class including its attributes, methods, class tag, a pointer to it's cgenNode
an offset for it, and a method of getting the information given only a curr_class. This was
stored in CgenTable but made available to  be looked up in cool-tree by calling the CgenTable
that we initialized.
